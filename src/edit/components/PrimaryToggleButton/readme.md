# PrimaryToggleButton

This is a custom component made specifically for forms build with simple form and the RepeatableField-component that has a "primary" value.

It has the purpose of toggling a "primary" value to `true` for a specific row while setting the primary value to `false` for the remaining rows â€“ ensuring that only one row is marked as "primary".

It's currently only used in contributor fields.
